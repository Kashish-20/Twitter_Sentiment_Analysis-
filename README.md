# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project uses Python libraries and Logistic Regression to analyze the sentiment of tweets. This project categorizes tweets as either positive or negative based on their content. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model can accurately identify the sentiment expressed in tweets, providing valuable insights into public opinion and trends. This project is a practical application of machine learning in sentiment analysis, useful for understanding social media dynamics.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
