Twitter Sentiment Analysis
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project uses Python libraries and Logistic Regression to analyze the sentiment of tweets. This project categorizes tweets as either positive or negative based on their content. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model can accurately identify the sentiment expressed in tweets, providing valuable insights into public opinion and trends. This project is a practical application of machine learning in sentiment analysis, useful for understanding social media dynamics.
